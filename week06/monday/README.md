# Backbone Practice

## Objectives

Achieve greater familiarity with Backbone syntax and structure by completing these exercises. Each exercise should have its own html and js file, named after the exercise. For example, exercise a should have an a.html and a a.js.

## Deliverables

a) Create a form that saves a blog post to http://tiny-starburst.herokuapp.com/collections/posts. The post should have a title and a body. It does not need to display blog posts, just save them.
b) Create a form for a person. It should have a first name, last name, address, and phone number. The form should validate the correct formats on submit. It should save the person to http://tiny-starburst.herokuapp.com/collections/people
c) Create a "blog reading app", where you have a list of blog posts on the side and when you click on a post title, it opens that post in another view. You can use the data at http://tiny-starburst.herokuapp.com/collections/posts.
d) Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated dynamically from the link collection). When you click on a tag, the link list should show only those tags. Hint: which tag is selected is "application state".
e) Create a todo app from scratch. Try not to look at any tutorials or other code.
