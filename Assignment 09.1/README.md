* Add methods to the prototype of a constructor

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `exercises.js`

### Requirements

* No console warnings or errors
* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output

## Easy Mode

Create a new Github repo and add [`exercises.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2015-Jan/homework-resources/master/constructors-and-prototypes/exercises.js) to it. Create your constructors and methods in that file.

You may use either the browser console by creating an index.html file, or you
